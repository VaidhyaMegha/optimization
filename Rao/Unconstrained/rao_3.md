# Rao-3 Algorithm Implementation in Python

## Overview
The Rao-3 algorithm is a heuristic optimization technique used to find the minimum of a function in a multidimensional space. In this implementation, the algorithm is used to solve the Sphere function, a well-known benchmark problem in optimization. The Sphere function is simply the sum of the squares of the variables and is used here to demonstrate the basic capabilities of the Rao-3 algorithm in finding the minimum in a continuous, convex, and unimodal landscape.

## Algorithm Description
The Rao-3 algorithm is part of a family of estimation of distribution algorithms. It works by iteratively improving a population of candidate solutions according to the Sphere function. The algorithm specifically focuses on manipulating the population by considering the best and worst solutions to guide the search towards optimal regions in the solution space.

### Key Components:
- **Initial Population**: Solutions are initialized randomly within specified bounds for each variable.
- **Evaluation**: Each candidate solution is evaluated using the Sphere function.
- **Update Mechanism**: New solutions are generated by mixing the properties of current solutions, biased towards the best solution found so far.
- **Bounding**: Solutions are kept within predefined bounds by clipping any variable that strays outside its limits.
- **Termination**: The algorithm terminates either after a fixed number of function evaluations or generations.

## Code Structure
- `objective(x)`: Computes the Sphere function, which is used to evaluate how good a solution is.
- `update_population(x, f)`: Modifies the current population by mixing attributes of the best, worst, and random solutions.
- `trimr(mini, maxi, x)`: Ensures all individuals in the population stay within the defined bounds for each variable.
- `rao_3()`: Main function that initializes the population, runs the optimization loop, and prints out the best solution found.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy library

## Running the Program
To run this program, ensure that Python and NumPy are installed on your system. You can execute the program from the command line:

```bash
python rao_3.py
```

This will run the Rao-3 algorithm using the Sphere function as the objective, print the progression of the algorithm through generations, and finally display the optimal solution found.

This implementation of the Rao-3 algorithm in Python provides a clear example of how heuristic optimization algorithms can be applied to solve simple functions. It serves as a foundation for more complex problems and other optimization methods.
